However, we don’t want all single age points, but we’d like to have age groups so we can use data transformation to assemble them as follows:\nage_distribution = data %% mutate(age_group = cut( `What is your age?`, breaks = c(0, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 100), labels = c(\"Under 20\", \"20-25\", \"26-30\", \"31-35\", \"36-40\", \"41-45\", \"46-50\", \"51-55\", \"56-60\", \"Over 60\") )) %% filter(!is.na(age_group))%% ggplot(aes(x=age_group, fill=`Have you been diagnosed with a mental health condition by a medical professional?`))+ geom_bar(position = \"dodge\")+ theme(legend.title = element_blank())+ labs(title=\"Have you been diagnosed with a mental health condition \\nby a medical professional?\")+ scale_fill_manual(values=met.brewer(\"Juarez\", 2)) Let’s see the result:\nplot(age_distribution) As someone pointed out though, comparison of bars across a span of age groups might be confusing: so we either split the groups, or we use in this case lines do better describe the differences. In this case we need however to change 2 things: - x axis should be continuous - if x is not continuous, stat should be count (as in bars) - x should be numeric: in order to do that, we need to use the factor of its values - we need to add the group element on top of the colour\nage_distribution = data %% mutate(age_group = cut( `What is your age?`, breaks = c(0, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 100), labels = c(\"Under 20\", \"20-25\", \"26-30\", \"31-35\", \"36-40\", \"41-45\", \"46-50\", \"51-55\", \"56-60\", \"Over 60\") )) %% filter(!is.na(age_group)) %% ggplot(aes(x=factor(age_group), colour=`Have you been diagnosed with a mental health condition by a medical professional?`, group = `Have you been diagnosed with a mental health condition by a medical professional?`))+ geom_freqpoly(stat = \"count\")+ theme(legend.title = element_blank())+ labs(title=\"Have you been diagnosed with a mental health condition \\nby a medical professional?\")+ scale_fill_manual(values=met.brewer(\"Juarez\", 2)) let’s see the result:\nplot(age_distribution) Pie chart - careful with pie charts.. very bad\ndata %% group_by(`Do you feel that your employer takes mental health as seriously as physical health?`) %% summarise(count = n()) %% mutate(percent = count / sum(count) * 100, response = `Do you feel that your employer takes mental health as seriously as physical health?`) %% select(response, count, percent) %% filter(!is.na(response)) %% ggplot(aes(x=\"\", y=percent, fill=response)) + geom_bar(stat=\"identity\", width=1) + coord_polar(\"y\", start=0) remove all stuff\ndata %% group_by(`Do you feel that your employer takes mental health as seriously as physical health?`) %% summarise(count = n()) %% mutate(percent = count / sum(count) * 100, response = `Do you feel that your employer takes mental health as seriously as physical health?`) %% select(response, count, percent) %% filter(!is.na(response)) %% ggplot(aes(x=\"\", y=percent, fill=response)) + geom_bar(stat=\"identity\", width=1) + coord_polar(\"y\", start=0)+ theme_void() add labels first compute labels and their position we can use the percentage\nemployer = data %% group_by(`Do you feel that your employer takes mental health as seriously as physical health?`) %% summarise(count = n()) %% mutate(percent = count / sum(count) * 100, response = `Do you feel that your employer takes mental health as seriously as physical health?`, percent_label = paste0(round(percent, digits = 1), \"%\") ) %% arrange(percent) %% select(response, count, percent, percent_label) %% filter(!is.na(response)) %% mutate(label_pos = cumsum(percent) - 0.5 * percent) %% ggplot(aes(x=\"\", y=percent, fill=response)) + geom_bar(stat=\"identity\", width=1) + coord_polar(\"y\", start=0)+ theme_void()+ geom_text(aes(y = label_pos, label = percent_label), color = \"white\", size=5) + scale_fill_manual(values = met.brewer(\"Egypt\", n=3))+ labs(title = \"Do you feel that your employer takes \\nmental health as seriously as physical health?\") Let’s see the result:\nplot(employer) now we do have a problem with pie charts in this particular case we notice a little less because we added in the labels with percentages let’s see an alternative\nfirst we save colours\negypt_cols3 = met.brewer(\"Egypt\", n=3) Then we can use the package treemapify to change it to a treemap\nemployers2 = data %% group_by(`Do you feel that your employer takes mental health as seriously as physical health?`) %% summarise(count = n()) %% mutate(percent = count / sum(count) * 100, response = `Do you feel that your employer takes mental health as seriously as physical health?`, percent_label = paste0(round(percent, digits = 1), \"%\") ) %% arrange(percent) %% select(response, count, percent, percent_label) %% filter(!is.na(response)) %% ggplot(aes(area=percent, fill=response, label = percent_label)) + geom_treemap()+ geom_treemap_text()+ scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"No\" = egypt_cols3[1], \"Yes\" = egypt_cols3[3], \"I don't know\" = egypt_cols3[2]))+ labs(title = \"Do you feel that your employer takes \\nmental health as seriously as physical health?\") Let’s see the result\nplot(employers2) Now let’s assemble everything together:\ngrid_left  And plot it:\nplot_grid(grid_left, grid_right, labels = c(''), ncol = 2) We can also save this in an SVG, which would help making further adjustments without spending additional hours in R:\nsvg(filename = \"storytelling_mental-health.svg\", width = 11, height = 8) plot_grid(grid_left, grid_right, labels = c(''), ncol = 2) dev.off() ## quartz_off_screen ## 2  ",

<h1>Loading data</h1>
<p>We have an important dataset on Attitudes towards Mental Illnesses, which is an interactive exploration of 2016 OSMI survey results.</p>
<p>First we load the necessary packages:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)
library(cowplot)
library(gghighlight)
library(knitr)
library(MetBrewer)
library(treemapify)</code></pre>
<p>Then we can load the dataset straight from the repository on github:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data &lt;- read_csv(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lescai-teaching/dataviz-rstudio/datasets/mental-heath-in-tech-2016_20161114.csv&quot;)</code></pre>

<h1>Exploring the data</h1>
<p>here you can use tab, to navigate long columns / variable names</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x=`Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with previous employers would have negative consequences?`,
             fill=`Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with previous employers would have negative consequences?`

<p><img src="/2022/05/18/storytelling-with-ggplot2/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>first I need to remove NA values</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data %&gt;%
  filter(!is.na(`Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with previous employers would have negative consequences?`)) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x=`Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with previous employers would have negative consequences?`,

  geom_bar()</code></pre>
<p><img src="/2022/05/18/storytelling-with-ggplot2/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>the title in the legend duplicates information</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data %&gt;%
  filter(!is.na(`Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with previous employers would have negative consequences?`)) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x=`Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with previous employers would have negative consequences?`,
             fill=`Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with previous employers would have negative consequences?`

<p><img src="/2022/05/18/storytelling-with-ggplot2/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>now maybe we could appreciate better the proportions if we fill one column</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data %&gt;%
  filter(!is.na(`Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with previous employers would have negative consequences?`)) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x=`Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with previous employers would have negative consequences?`,

<p><img src="/2022/05/18/storytelling-with-ggplot2/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>but it doesn’t work this way because if we use the x as answer they get separated
we could use a trick</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data %&gt;%
  filter(!is.na(`Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with previous employers would have negative consequences?`)) %&gt;%

<p><img src="/2022/05/18/storytelling-with-ggplot2/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>but its a trick
a better way would be to calculate the values
and percentages as well</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data %&gt;%
  filter(!is.na(`Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with previous employers would have negative consequences?`)) %&gt;%
  group_by(`Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with previous employers would have negative consequences?`) %&gt;%
  summarise(count = n()) %&gt;%
  mutate(percent = count / sum(count))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 3 x 3
##   `Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with prev… count percent
##   &lt;chr&gt;                                                            &lt;int&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;

<p>now we can plot again</p>

<p>we can make it prettier</p>

<p>assign them to object</p>
<p>use cowplot to arrange</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot_grid(health_issue, mental_issue, labels = c(&#39;A&#39;, &#39;B&#39;), label_size = 12, ncol = 1, align = &#39;v&#39;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/2022/05/18/storytelling-with-ggplot2/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>of course colours are not in sync
explain order of colour = they are assigned in the order we see in the legend
the first one is not present in the first plot, so we need to start from second</p>
<pre class="r"><code>colours = met.brewer(&quot;Derain&quot;, n=4)</code></pre>
<p>Now we can change the colours:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>health_issue = health_issue + scale_fill_manual(values = colours[2:4])
mental_issue = mental_issue + scale_fill_manual(values = colours)</code></pre>
<p>And assemble the group again</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot_grid(health_issue, mental_issue, labels = c(&#39;A&#39;, &#39;B&#39;), label_size = 12, ncol = 1, align = &#39;v&#39;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/2022/05/18/storytelling-with-ggplot2/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>we can be more picky in terms of axes and tick marks</p>
<pre class="r"><code>health_issue = health_issue + theme(
  axis.text = element_blank(),
  axis.ticks = element_blank(),
  plot.background = element_blank(),
  panel.grid = element_blank()

mental_issue = mental_issue + theme(
  axis.text = element_blank(),
  axis.ticks = element_blank(),
  plot.background = element_blank(),
  panel.grid = element_blank()
)</code></pre>
<p>And assemble it again:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot_grid(health_issue, mental_issue, labels = c(&#39;A&#39;, &#39;B&#39;), label_size = 12, ncol = 1, align = &#39;v&#39;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/2022/05/18/storytelling-with-ggplot2/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>We might want to add information here, and for example explore the age distribution.
However, we don’t want all single age points, but we’d like to have age groups so we can use data transformation to assemble them as follows:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>age_distribution = data %&gt;%
  mutate(age_group = cut(
    `What is your age?`, 
    breaks = c(0, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 100),
    labels = c(&quot;Under 20&quot;, &quot;20-25&quot;, &quot;26-30&quot;, &quot;31-35&quot;, &quot;36-40&quot;, &quot;41-45&quot;, &quot;46-50&quot;, &quot;51-55&quot;, &quot;56-60&quot;, &quot;Over 60&quot;)
    )) %&gt;%
  filter(!is.na(age_group))%&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x=age_group, fill=`Have you been diagnosed with a mental health condition by a medical professional?`))+
  geom_bar(position = &quot;dodge&quot;)+
  theme(legend.title = element_blank())+
  labs(title=&quot;Have you been diagnosed with a mental health condition \nby a medical professional?&quot;)+
  scale_fill_manual(values=met.brewer(&quot;Juarez&quot;, 2))</code></pre>
<p>Let’s see the result:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot(age_distribution)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/2022/05/18/storytelling-with-ggplot2/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>As someone pointed out though, comparison of bars across a span of age groups might be confusing: so we either split the groups, or we use in this case lines do better describe the differences.
In this case we need however to change 2 things:
- x axis should be continuous
- if x is not continuous, stat should be count (as in bars)
- x should be numeric: in order to do that, we need to use the factor of its values
- we need to add the <em>group</em> element on top of the colour</p>
<pre class="r"><code>age_distribution = data %&gt;%
  mutate(age_group = cut(
    `What is your age?`, 
    breaks = c(0, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 100),
    labels = c(&quot;Under 20&quot;, &quot;20-25&quot;, &quot;26-30&quot;, &quot;31-35&quot;, &quot;36-40&quot;, &quot;41-45&quot;, &quot;46-50&quot;, &quot;51-55&quot;, &quot;56-60&quot;, &quot;Over 60&quot;)

<p>add labels
first compute labels and their position
we can use the percentage</p>
<pre class="r"><code>employer = data %&gt;%
  group_by(`Do you feel that your employer takes mental health as seriously as physical health?`) %&gt;%
  summarise(count = n()) %&gt;%
  mutate(percent = count / sum(count) * 100,
         response = `Do you feel that your employer takes mental health as seriously as physical health?`,
         percent_label = paste0(round(percent, digits = 1), &quot;%&quot;)
         ) %&gt;%
  arrange(percent) %&gt;%
  select(response, count, percent, percent_label) %&gt;%
  filter(!is.na(response)) %&gt;%
  mutate(label_pos = cumsum(percent) - 0.5 * percent) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x=&quot;&quot;, y=percent, fill=response)) +
  geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;, width=1) +
  coord_polar(&quot;y&quot;, start=0)+
  theme_void()+
  geom_text(aes(y = label_pos, label = percent_label), color = &quot;white&quot;, size=5) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = met.brewer(&quot;Egypt&quot;, n=3))+
  labs(title = &quot;Do you feel that your employer takes \nmental health as seriously as physical health?&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Let’s see the result:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot(employer)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/2022/05/18/storytelling-with-ggplot2/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-26-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>now we do have a problem with pie charts
in this particular case we notice a little less
because we added in the labels with percentages
let’s see an alternative</p>
<p>first we save colours</p>
<pre class="r"><code>egypt_cols3 = met.brewer(&quot;Egypt&quot;, n=3)</code></pre>
<p>Then we can use the package <em>treemapify</em> to change it to a treemap</p>
<pre class="r"><code>employers2 = data %&gt;%
  group_by(`Do you feel that your employer takes mental health as seriously as physical health?`) %&gt;%
  summarise(count = n()) %&gt;%
  mutate(percent = count / sum(count) * 100,
         response = `Do you feel that your employer takes mental health as seriously as physical health?`,
         percent_label = paste0(round(percent, digits = 1), &quot;%&quot;)
  ) %&gt;%
  arrange(percent) %&gt;%
  select(response, count, percent, percent_label) %&gt;%
  filter(!is.na(response)) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(area=percent, fill=response, label = percent_label)) +
  geom_treemap()+
  geom_treemap_text()+
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(&quot;No&quot; = egypt_cols3[1],
                               &quot;Yes&quot; = egypt_cols3[3],
                               &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; = egypt_cols3[2]))+
  labs(title = &quot;Do you feel that your employer takes \nmental health as seriously as physical health?&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Let’s see the result</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot(employers2)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/2022/05/18/storytelling-with-ggplot2/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-29-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Now let’s assemble everything together:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>grid_left &lt;- plot_grid(employers2, health_issue, mental_issue, labels = c(&#39;A&#39;, &#39;B&#39;, &#39;C&#39;), label_size = 12, ncol = 1, align = &#39;v&#39;)
grid_right &lt;- plot_grid(age_distribution, labels = c(&#39;D&#39;), label_size = 12, ncol = 1, align = &#39;v&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>And plot it:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot_grid(grid_left, grid_right, labels = c(&#39;&#39;), ncol = 2)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/2022/05/18/storytelling-with-ggplot2/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-31-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>We can also save this in an SVG, which would help making further adjustments without spending additional hours in R:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>svg(filename = &quot;storytelling_mental-health.svg&quot;, width = 11, height = 8)
plot_grid(grid_left, grid_right, labels = c(&#39;&#39;), ncol = 2)
dev.off()</code></pre>
<pre><code>## quartz_off_screen 
##                 2</code></pre>
