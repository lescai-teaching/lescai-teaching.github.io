If you have a mental health issue, do you feel that it interferes with your work when being treated effectively?    If you have a mental health issue, do you feel that it interferes with your work when NOT being treated effectively?    What is your age?    What is your gender?    What country do you live in?    What US state or territory do you live in?    What country do you work in?    What US state or territory do you work in?    Which of the following best describes your work position?    Do you work remotely?      Exploring the data When we build the following code, one can use tab to navigate long columns / variable names. First we will create a basic bar plot, and take it from there:\ndata %% ggplot(aes(x=`Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with previous employers would have negative consequences?`, fill=`Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with previous employers would have negative consequences?` ))+ geom_bar() In a plot, this is not even visible in the figure box. The categories clearly include NA values, which need to be removed. We do that with the following code:\ndata %% filter(!is.na(`Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with previous employers would have negative consequences?`)) %% ggplot(aes(x=`Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with previous employers would have negative consequences?`, fill=`Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with previous employers would have negative consequences?` ))+ geom_bar() This figure has the same problem, and it is not even visible on a figure box in the page.\nThe title in the legend duplicates information, so we can just remove the title keeping the legend as it is with the following code:\ndata %% filter(!is.na(`Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with previous employers would have negative consequences?`)) %% ggplot(aes(x=`Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with previous employers would have negative consequences?`, fill=`Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with previous employers would have negative consequences?` ))+ geom_bar()+ theme(legend.title = element_blank()) Now maybe we could appreciate better the proportions of the different categories, if we fill one column as follows:\ndata %% filter(!is.na(`Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with previous employers would have negative consequences?`)) %% ggplot(aes(x=`Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with previous employers would have negative consequences?`, fill=`Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with previous employers would have negative consequences?` ))+ geom_bar(position = \"fill\")+ theme(legend.title = element_blank()) but it doesn’t work this way because if we use the x as answer they get separated we could use a trick\ndata %% filter(!is.na(`Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with previous employers would have negative consequences?`)) %% ggplot(aes(x=1, fill=`Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with previous employers would have negative consequences?` ))+ geom_bar(position = \"fill\")+ theme(legend.title = element_blank()) but its a trick a better way would be to calculate the values and percentages as well using summarise and mutate of the package dplyr\ndata %% filter(!is.na(`Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with previous employers would have negative consequences?`)) %% group_by(`Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with previous employers would have negative consequences?`) %% summarise(count = n()) %% mutate(percent = count / sum(count)) ## # A tibble: 3 x 3 ## `Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with prev… count percent ##    ## 1 None of them 559 0.442 ## 2 Some of them 631 0.499 ## 3 Yes, all of them 74 0.0585 now we can plot again\ndata %% filter(!is.na(`Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with previous employers would have negative consequences?`)) %% group_by(`Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with previous employers would have negative consequences?`) %% summarise(count = n()) %% mutate(percent = count / sum(count)) %% ggplot(aes( x=1, y=percent, fill=`Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with previous employers would have negative consequences?` ))+ geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"fill\")+ theme(legend.title = element_blank()) we can make it prettier, by adding labels to the axes and a proper title to the figure:\nhealth_issue = data %% filter(!is.na(`Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with previous employers would have negative consequences?`)) %% group_by(`Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with previous employers would have negative consequences?`) %% summarise(count = n()) %% mutate(percent = count / sum(count)) %% ggplot(aes( x=1, y=percent, fill=`Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with previous employers would have negative consequences?` ))+ geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"fill\")+ theme(legend.title = element_blank())+ geom_text(aes(label = paste0(round(percent*100, digits = 1), \"%\")), position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5))+ labs(x=\"\", y=\"percent responses\", title = \"Do you think that discussing a physical health issue \\nwith previous employers would have negative consequences?\")+ coord_flip() And inspect the result:\nplot(health_issue) Now we have something interesting we can compare, and we can use the same code to plot the attitude towards mental issues instead:\nmental_issue = data %% filter(!is.na(`Do you think that discussing a mental health disorder with previous employers would have negative consequences?`)) %% group_by(`Do you think that discussing a mental health disorder with previous employers would have negative consequences?`) %% summarise(count = n()) %% mutate(percent = count / sum(count)) %% ggplot(aes( x=1, y=percent, fill=`Do you think that discussing a mental health disorder with previous employers would have negative consequences?` ))+ geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"fill\")+ theme(legend.title = element_blank())+ geom_text(aes(label = paste0(round(percent*100, digits = 1), \"%\")), position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5))+ labs(x=\"\", y=\"percent responses\", title = \"Do you think that discussing a mental health disorder \\nwith previous employers would have negative consequences?\")+ coord_flip() And inspect the results:\nplot(mental_issue) A very useful package named cowplot comes in very handy to combine plots together, and arrange them in a quite flexible way compared to the native grid system. Using this function we can combine the two plots above, and better visualise the comparison:\nplot_grid(health_issue, mental_issue, labels = c('A', 'B'), label_size = 12, ncol = 1, align = 'v') Since colours are chosen based on the categories available in the data, they are not in sync (we have a different number of categories in the two responses). To solve this, we need to choose a vector of colours, and use the same vector for both plots. Colours are assigned in the order we see in the legend: since the first category of the second plot is not present in the first plot, we need to start from the second colour in our vector when we describe the first plot.\ncolours = met.brewer(\"Derain\", n=4) Now we can change the colours:\nhealth_issue = health_issue + scale_fill_manual(values = colours[2:4]) mental_issue = mental_issue + scale_fill_manual(values = colours) And assemble the group again\nplot_grid(health_issue, mental_issue, labels = c('A', 'B'), label_size = 12, ncol = 1, align = 'v') If we look closely, we realise that we can be more picky in terms of axes and tick marks\nhealth_issue = health_issue + theme( axis.text = element_blank(), axis.ticks = element_blank(), plot.background = element_blank(), panel.grid = element_blank() ) mental_issue = mental_issue + theme( axis.text = element_blank(), axis.ticks = element_blank(), plot.background = element_blank(), panel.grid = element_blank() ) And assemble it again:\nplot_grid(health_issue, mental_issue, labels = c('A', 'B'), label_size = 12, ncol = 1, align = 'v') We might want to add information here, and for example explore the age distribution. However, we don’t want all single age points, but we’d like to have age groups so we can use data transformation to assemble them as follows:\nage_distribution = data %% mutate(age_group = cut( `What is your age?`, breaks = c(0, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 100), labels = c(\"Under 20\", \"20-25\", \"26-30\", \"31-35\", \"36-40\", \"41-45\", \"46-50\", \"51-55\", \"56-60\", \"Over 60\") )) %% filter(!is.na(age_group))%% ggplot(aes(x=age_group, fill=`Have you been diagnosed with a mental health condition by a medical professional?`))+ geom_bar(position = \"dodge\")+ theme(legend.title = element_blank())+ labs(title=\"Have you been diagnosed with a mental health condition \\nby a medical professional?\")+ scale_fill_manual(values=met.brewer(\"Juarez\", 2)) Let’s see the result:\nplot(age_distribution) As someone pointed out though, comparison of bars across a span of age groups might be confusing: so we either split the groups, or we use in this case lines do better describe the differences. In this case we need however to change 2 things: - x axis should be continuous - if x is not continuous, stat should be count (as in bars) - x should be numeric: in order to do that, we need to use the factor of its values - we need to add the group element on top of the colour\nage_distribution = data %% mutate(age_group = cut( `What is your age?`, breaks = c(0, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 100), labels = c(\"Under 20\", \"20-25\", \"26-30\", \"31-35\", \"36-40\", \"41-45\", \"46-50\", \"51-55\", \"56-60\", \"Over 60\") )) %% filter(!is.na(age_group)) %% ggplot(aes(x=factor(age_group), colour=`Have you been diagnosed with a mental health condition by a medical professional?`, group = `Have you been diagnosed with a mental health condition by a medical professional?`))+ geom_freqpoly(stat = \"count\")+ theme(legend.title = element_blank())+ labs(title=\"Have you been diagnosed with a mental health condition \\nby a medical professional?\", x = \"age group\")+ scale_fill_manual(values=met.brewer(\"Juarez\", 2)) let’s see the result:\nplot(age_distribution) Another element which might help us telling a story, is the question whether the employers take mental health seriously. In order to display a proportion, we might want to build a pie chart.\ndata %% group_by(`Do you feel that your employer takes mental health as seriously as physical health?`) %% summarise(count = n()) %% mutate(percent = count / sum(count) * 100, response = `Do you feel that your employer takes mental health as seriously as physical health?`) %% select(response, count, percent) %% filter(!is.na(response)) %% ggplot(aes(x=\"\", y=percent, fill=response)) + geom_bar(stat=\"identity\", width=1) + coord_polar(\"y\", start=0) Progressively, we should remove all additional elements we don’t need:\ndata %% group_by(`Do you feel that your employer takes mental health as seriously as physical health?`) %% summarise(count = n()) %% mutate(percent = count / sum(count) * 100, response = `Do you feel that your employer takes mental health as seriously as physical health?`) %% select(response, count, percent) %% filter(!is.na(response)) %% ggplot(aes(x=\"\", y=percent, fill=response)) + geom_bar(stat=\"identity\", width=1) + coord_polar(\"y\", start=0)+ theme_void() Then, we can add labels. In order to create the labels, we need first to create them from a numeric value and also use the value to compute the position of the labels on the pie chart (note the position is relative to the proportion compared to the total). We can use the percentage as label.\nemployer = data %% group_by(`Do you feel that your employer takes mental health as seriously as physical health?`) %% summarise(count = n()) %% mutate(percent = count / sum(count) * 100, response = `Do you feel that your employer takes mental health as seriously as physical health?`, percent_label = paste0(round(percent, digits = 1), \"%\") ) %% arrange(percent) %% select(response, count, percent, percent_label) %% filter(!is.na(response)) %% mutate(label_pos = cumsum(percent) - 0.5 * percent) %% ggplot(aes(x=\"\", y=percent, fill=response)) + geom_bar(stat=\"identity\", width=1) + coord_polar(\"y\", start=0)+ theme_void()+ geom_text(aes(y = label_pos, label = percent_label), color = \"white\", size=5) + scale_fill_manual(values = met.brewer(\"Egypt\", n=3))+ labs(title = \"Do you feel that your employer takes \\nmental health as seriously as physical health?\") Let’s see the result:\nplot(employer) We have discussed what the problem with pie charts might be. In this particular case the difficulty in spotting patterns is less of a problem, because:\n we added in the labels with percentages we only have three categories  As an alternative, we could use the tree map plot.\nFirst, we should save the colours so we can produce a plot with similar feeling:\negypt_cols3 = met.brewer(\"Egypt\", n=3) Then we can use the package treemapify to change it to a treemap\nemployers2 = data %% group_by(`Do you feel that your employer takes mental health as seriously as physical health?`) %% summarise(count = n()) %% mutate(percent = count / sum(count) * 100, response = `Do you feel that your employer takes mental health as seriously as physical health?`, percent_label = paste0(round(percent, digits = 1), \"%\") ) %% arrange(percent) %% select(response, count, percent, percent_label) %% filter(!is.na(response)) %% ggplot(aes(area=percent, fill=response, label = percent_label)) + geom_treemap()+ geom_treemap_text()+ scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"No\" = egypt_cols3[1], \"Yes\" = egypt_cols3[3], \"I don't know\" = egypt_cols3[2]))+ labs(title = \"Do you feel that your employer takes \\nmental health as seriously as physical health?\") Let’s see the result\nplot(employers2) Now let’s assemble everything together:\ngrid_left  And plot it:\nplot_grid(grid_left, grid_right, labels = c(''), ncol = 2) We can also save this in an SVG, which would help making further adjustments without spending additional hours in R:\nsvg(filename = \"storytelling_mental-health.svg\", width = 11, height = 8) plot_grid(grid_left, grid_right, labels = c(''), ncol = 2) dev.off() ## quartz_off_screen ## 2 If we wanted to complete the poster with an overall title, this can be also done assembling layers of plots with cowplot.\nWe can start by making a title (it has to be done with very basic functions):\ntitle  We can save the main poster as an object:\nmain_poster  And then assemble the two also using the function plot_grid\nplot_grid( title, main_poster, ncol = 1, rel_heights = c(0.1,1) )  ",

<h1>Loading data</h1>
<p>To showcase the approach to storytelling, we have chosen a dataset on Attitudes towards Mental Illnesses.
This is the collection of 2016 OSMI survey results.</p>
<p>First we need to load the necessary packages:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)
library(cowplot)
library(gghighlight)
library(knitr)
library(MetBrewer)
library(treemapify)
library(kableExtra)</code></pre>
<p>Then we can load the dataset straight from the repository on github:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data &lt;- read_csv(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lescai-teaching/dataviz-rstudio/datasets/mental-heath-in-tech-2016_20161114.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>We can now inspect what the dataset contains, by printing a table of its variables:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>names(data) %&gt;%
  kable(&quot;html&quot;) %&gt;%
  kable_styling(font_size = 7,
                bootstrap_options = &quot;striped&quot;, 
                full_width = F, 
                position = &quot;center&quot;
                )</code></pre>

<div id="exploring-the-data" class="section level1">
<h1>Exploring the data</h1>
<p>When we build the following code, one can use tab to navigate long columns / variable names.
First we will create a basic bar plot, and take it from there:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x=`Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with previous employers would have negative consequences?`,
             fill=`Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with previous employers would have negative consequences?`
             ))+
  geom_bar()</code></pre>
<p><img src="/2022/05/18/storytelling-with-ggplot2/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>In a plot, this is not even visible in the figure box.
The categories clearly include NA values, which need to be removed.
We do that with the following code:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data %&gt;%
  filter(!is.na(`Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with previous employers would have negative consequences?`)) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x=`Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with previous employers would have negative consequences?`,
             fill=`Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with previous employers would have negative consequences?`
  ))+
  geom_bar()</code></pre>
<p><img src="/2022/05/18/storytelling-with-ggplot2/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>This figure has the same problem, and it is not even visible on a figure box in the page.<br />
The title in the legend duplicates information, so we can just remove the title keeping the legend as it is with the following code:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data %&gt;%
  filter(!is.na(`Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with previous employers would have negative consequences?`)) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x=`Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with previous employers would have negative consequences?`,
             fill=`Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with previous employers would have negative consequences?`
  ))+
  geom_bar()+
  theme(legend.title = element_blank())</code></pre>
<p><img src="/2022/05/18/storytelling-with-ggplot2/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Now maybe we could appreciate better the proportions of the different categories, if we fill one column as follows:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data %&gt;%
  filter(!is.na(`Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with previous employers would have negative consequences?`)) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x=`Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with previous employers would have negative consequences?`,
             fill=`Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with previous employers would have negative consequences?`
  ))+
  geom_bar(position = &quot;fill&quot;)+
  theme(legend.title = element_blank())</code></pre>
<p><img src="/2022/05/18/storytelling-with-ggplot2/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>but it doesn’t work this way because if we use the x as answer they get separated
we could use a trick</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data %&gt;%
  filter(!is.na(`Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with previous employers would have negative consequences?`)) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x=1,
             fill=`Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with previous employers would have negative consequences?`
  ))+
  geom_bar(position = &quot;fill&quot;)+
  theme(legend.title = element_blank())</code></pre>
<p><img src="/2022/05/18/storytelling-with-ggplot2/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>but its a trick
a better way would be to calculate the values and percentages as well using summarise and mutate of the package <em>dplyr</em></p>
<pre class="r"><code>data %&gt;%
  filter(!is.na(`Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with previous employers would have negative consequences?`)) %&gt;%
  group_by(`Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with previous employers would have negative consequences?`) %&gt;%
  summarise(count = n()) %&gt;%
  mutate(percent = count / sum(count))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 3 x 3
##   `Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with prev… count percent
##   &lt;chr&gt;                                                            &lt;int&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 None of them                                                       559  0.442 
## 2 Some of them                                                       631  0.499 
## 3 Yes, all of them                                                    74  0.0585</code></pre>
<p>now we can plot again</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data %&gt;%
  filter(!is.na(`Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with previous employers would have negative consequences?`)) %&gt;%
  group_by(`Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with previous employers would have negative consequences?`) %&gt;%
  summarise(count = n()) %&gt;%
  mutate(percent = count / sum(count)) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(
    x=1,
    y=percent,
    fill=`Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with previous employers would have negative consequences?`
  ))+
  geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;, position = &quot;fill&quot;)+
  theme(legend.title = element_blank())</code></pre>
<p><img src="/2022/05/18/storytelling-with-ggplot2/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>we can make it prettier, by adding labels to the axes and a proper title to the figure:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>health_issue = data %&gt;%
  filter(!is.na(`Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with previous employers would have negative consequences?`)) %&gt;%
  group_by(`Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with previous employers would have negative consequences?`) %&gt;%
  summarise(count = n()) %&gt;%
  mutate(percent = count / sum(count)) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(
    x=1,
    y=percent,
    fill=`Do you think that discussing a physical health issue with previous employers would have negative consequences?`
  ))+
  geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;, position = &quot;fill&quot;)+
  theme(legend.title = element_blank())+
  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(round(percent*100, digits = 1), &quot;%&quot;)), position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5))+
  labs(x=&quot;&quot;, 
       y=&quot;percent responses&quot;,
       title = &quot;Do you think that discussing a physical health issue \nwith previous employers would have negative consequences?&quot;)+
  coord_flip()</code></pre>
<p>And inspect the result:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot(health_issue)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/2022/05/18/storytelling-with-ggplot2/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Now we have something interesting we can compare, and we can use the same code to plot the attitude towards mental issues instead:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>mental_issue = data %&gt;%
  filter(!is.na(`Do you think that discussing a mental health disorder with previous employers would have negative consequences?`)) %&gt;%
  group_by(`Do you think that discussing a mental health disorder with previous employers would have negative consequences?`) %&gt;%
  summarise(count = n()) %&gt;%
  mutate(percent = count / sum(count)) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(
    x=1,
    y=percent,
    fill=`Do you think that discussing a mental health disorder with previous employers would have negative consequences?`
  ))+
  geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;, position = &quot;fill&quot;)+
  theme(legend.title = element_blank())+
  geom_text(aes(label = paste0(round(percent*100, digits = 1), &quot;%&quot;)), position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5))+
  labs(x=&quot;&quot;, 
       y=&quot;percent responses&quot;,
       title = &quot;Do you think that discussing a mental health disorder \nwith previous employers would have negative consequences?&quot;)+
  coord_flip()</code></pre>
<p>And inspect the results:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot(mental_issue)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/2022/05/18/storytelling-with-ggplot2/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>A very useful package named <strong>cowplot</strong> comes in very handy to combine plots together, and arrange them in a quite flexible way compared to the native grid system.
Using this function we can combine the two plots above, and better visualise the comparison:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot_grid(health_issue, mental_issue, labels = c(&#39;A&#39;, &#39;B&#39;), label_size = 12, ncol = 1, align = &#39;v&#39;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/2022/05/18/storytelling-with-ggplot2/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Since colours are chosen based on the categories available in the data, they are not in sync (we have a different number of categories in the two responses).
To solve this, we need to choose a vector of colours, and use the same vector for both plots.
Colours are assigned in the order we see in the legend: since the first category of the second plot is not present in the first plot, we need to start from the second colour in our vector when we describe the first plot.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>colours = met.brewer(&quot;Derain&quot;, n=4)</code></pre>
<p>Now we can change the colours:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>health_issue = health_issue + scale_fill_manual(values = colours[2:4])
mental_issue = mental_issue + scale_fill_manual(values = colours)</code></pre>
<p>And assemble the group again</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot_grid(health_issue, mental_issue, labels = c(&#39;A&#39;, &#39;B&#39;), label_size = 12, ncol = 1, align = &#39;v&#39;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/2022/05/18/storytelling-with-ggplot2/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>If we look closely, we realise that we can be more picky in terms of axes and tick marks</p>
<pre class="r"><code>health_issue = health_issue + theme(
  axis.text = element_blank(),
  axis.ticks = element_blank(),
  plot.background = element_blank(),
  panel.grid = element_blank()
)

mental_issue = mental_issue + theme(
  axis.text = element_blank(),
  axis.ticks = element_blank(),
  plot.background = element_blank(),
  panel.grid = element_blank()
)</code></pre>
<p>And assemble it again:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot_grid(health_issue, mental_issue, labels = c(&#39;A&#39;, &#39;B&#39;), label_size = 12, ncol = 1, align = &#39;v&#39;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/2022/05/18/storytelling-with-ggplot2/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>We might want to add information here, and for example explore the age distribution.
However, we don’t want all single age points, but we’d like to have age groups so we can use data transformation to assemble them as follows:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>age_distribution = data %&gt;%
  mutate(age_group = cut(
    `What is your age?`, 
    breaks = c(0, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 100),
    labels = c(&quot;Under 20&quot;, &quot;20-25&quot;, &quot;26-30&quot;, &quot;31-35&quot;, &quot;36-40&quot;, &quot;41-45&quot;, &quot;46-50&quot;, &quot;51-55&quot;, &quot;56-60&quot;, &quot;Over 60&quot;)
    )) %&gt;%
  filter(!is.na(age_group))%&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x=age_group, fill=`Have you been diagnosed with a mental health condition by a medical professional?`))+
  geom_bar(position = &quot;dodge&quot;)+
  theme(legend.title = element_blank())+
  labs(title=&quot;Have you been diagnosed with a mental health condition \nby a medical professional?&quot;)+
  scale_fill_manual(values=met.brewer(&quot;Juarez&quot;, 2))</code></pre>
<p>Let’s see the result:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot(age_distribution)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/2022/05/18/storytelling-with-ggplot2/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-22-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>As someone pointed out though, comparison of bars across a span of age groups might be confusing: so we either split the groups, or we use in this case lines do better describe the differences.
In this case we need however to change 2 things:
- x axis should be continuous
- if x is not continuous, stat should be count (as in bars)
- x should be numeric: in order to do that, we need to use the factor of its values
- we need to add the <em>group</em> element on top of the colour</p>
<pre class="r"><code>age_distribution = data %&gt;%
  mutate(age_group = cut(
    `What is your age?`, 
    breaks = c(0, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 100),
    labels = c(&quot;Under 20&quot;, &quot;20-25&quot;, &quot;26-30&quot;, &quot;31-35&quot;, &quot;36-40&quot;, &quot;41-45&quot;, &quot;46-50&quot;, &quot;51-55&quot;, &quot;56-60&quot;, &quot;Over 60&quot;)
    )) %&gt;%
  filter(!is.na(age_group)) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x=factor(age_group), 
             colour=`Have you been diagnosed with a mental health condition by a medical professional?`, 
             group = `Have you been diagnosed with a mental health condition by a medical professional?`))+
  geom_freqpoly(stat = &quot;count&quot;)+
  theme(legend.title = element_blank())+
  labs(title=&quot;Have you been diagnosed with a mental health condition \nby a medical professional?&quot;,
       x = &quot;age group&quot;)+
  scale_fill_manual(values=met.brewer(&quot;Juarez&quot;, 2))</code></pre>
<p>let’s see the result:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot(age_distribution)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/2022/05/18/storytelling-with-ggplot2/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-24-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Another element which might help us telling a story, is the question whether the employers take mental health seriously.
In order to display a proportion, we might want to build a pie chart.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data %&gt;%
  group_by(`Do you feel that your employer takes mental health as seriously as physical health?`) %&gt;%
  summarise(count = n()) %&gt;%
  mutate(percent = count / sum(count) * 100,
         response = `Do you feel that your employer takes mental health as seriously as physical health?`) %&gt;%
  select(response, count, percent) %&gt;%
  filter(!is.na(response)) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x=&quot;&quot;, y=percent, fill=response)) +
  geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;, width=1) +
  coord_polar(&quot;y&quot;, start=0)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/2022/05/18/storytelling-with-ggplot2/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-25-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Progressively, we should remove all additional elements we don’t need:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data %&gt;%
  group_by(`Do you feel that your employer takes mental health as seriously as physical health?`) %&gt;%
  summarise(count = n()) %&gt;%
  mutate(percent = count / sum(count) * 100,
         response = `Do you feel that your employer takes mental health as seriously as physical health?`) %&gt;%
  select(response, count, percent) %&gt;%
  filter(!is.na(response)) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x=&quot;&quot;, y=percent, fill=response)) +
  geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;, width=1) +
  coord_polar(&quot;y&quot;, start=0)+
  theme_void()</code></pre>
<p><img src="/2022/05/18/storytelling-with-ggplot2/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-26-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Then, we can add labels.
In order to create the labels, we need first to create them from a numeric value and also use the value to compute the position of the labels on the pie chart (note the position is relative to the proportion compared to the total).
We can use the percentage as label.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>employer = data %&gt;%
  group_by(`Do you feel that your employer takes mental health as seriously as physical health?`) %&gt;%
  summarise(count = n()) %&gt;%
  mutate(percent = count / sum(count) * 100,
         response = `Do you feel that your employer takes mental health as seriously as physical health?`,
         percent_label = paste0(round(percent, digits = 1), &quot;%&quot;)
         ) %&gt;%
  arrange(percent) %&gt;%
  select(response, count, percent, percent_label) %&gt;%
  filter(!is.na(response)) %&gt;%
  mutate(label_pos = cumsum(percent) - 0.5 * percent) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x=&quot;&quot;, y=percent, fill=response)) +
  geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;, width=1) +
  coord_polar(&quot;y&quot;, start=0)+
  theme_void()+
  geom_text(aes(y = label_pos, label = percent_label), color = &quot;white&quot;, size=5) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = met.brewer(&quot;Egypt&quot;, n=3))+
  labs(title = &quot;Do you feel that your employer takes \nmental health as seriously as physical health?&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Let’s see the result:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot(employer)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/2022/05/18/storytelling-with-ggplot2/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-28-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>We have discussed what the problem with pie charts might be.
In this particular case the difficulty in spotting patterns is less of a problem, because:</p>
<ul>
<li>we added in the labels with percentages</li>
<li>we only have three categories</li>
</ul>
<p>As an alternative, we could use the tree map plot.</p>
<p>First, we should save the colours so we can produce a plot with similar feeling:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>egypt_cols3 = met.brewer(&quot;Egypt&quot;, n=3)</code></pre>
<p>Then we can use the package <em>treemapify</em> to change it to a treemap</p>
<pre class="r"><code>employers2 = data %&gt;%
  group_by(`Do you feel that your employer takes mental health as seriously as physical health?`) %&gt;%
  summarise(count = n()) %&gt;%
  mutate(percent = count / sum(count) * 100,
         response = `Do you feel that your employer takes mental health as seriously as physical health?`,
         percent_label = paste0(round(percent, digits = 1), &quot;%&quot;)
  ) %&gt;%
  arrange(percent) %&gt;%
  select(response, count, percent, percent_label) %&gt;%
  filter(!is.na(response)) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(area=percent, fill=response, label = percent_label)) +
  geom_treemap()+
  geom_treemap_text()+
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(&quot;No&quot; = egypt_cols3[1],
                               &quot;Yes&quot; = egypt_cols3[3],
                               &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; = egypt_cols3[2]))+
  labs(title = &quot;Do you feel that your employer takes \nmental health as seriously as physical health?&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Let’s see the result</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot(employers2)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/2022/05/18/storytelling-with-ggplot2/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-31-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Now let’s assemble everything together:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>grid_left &lt;- plot_grid(employers2, health_issue, mental_issue, labels = c(&#39;A&#39;, &#39;B&#39;, &#39;C&#39;), label_size = 12, ncol = 1, align = &#39;v&#39;)
grid_right &lt;- plot_grid(age_distribution, labels = c(&#39;D&#39;), label_size = 12, ncol = 1, align = &#39;v&#39;)</code></pre>
<p>And plot it:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot_grid(grid_left, grid_right, labels = c(&#39;&#39;), ncol = 2)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/2022/05/18/storytelling-with-ggplot2/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-33-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>We can also save this in an SVG, which would help making further adjustments without spending additional hours in R:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>svg(filename = &quot;storytelling_mental-health.svg&quot;, width = 11, height = 8)
plot_grid(grid_left, grid_right, labels = c(&#39;&#39;), ncol = 2)
dev.off()</code></pre>
<pre><code>## quartz_off_screen 
##                 2</code></pre>
<p>If we wanted to complete the poster with an overall title, this can be also done assembling layers of plots with cowplot.</p>
<p>We can start by making a title (it has to be done with very basic functions):</p>
<pre class="r"><code>title &lt;- ggdraw()+
  draw_label(&quot;Attitudes towards mental health in the workplace&quot;, fontface = &quot;bold&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>We can save the main poster as an object:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>main_poster &lt;- plot_grid(grid_left, grid_right, labels = c(&#39;&#39;), ncol = 2)</code></pre>
<p>And then assemble the two also using the function <em>plot_grid</em></p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot_grid(
  title,
  main_poster,
  ncol = 1,
  rel_heights = c(0.1,1)
)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/2022/05/18/storytelling-with-ggplot2/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-37-1.png" width="672" /></p>
